## 📘 Academic Title
**An AI-Based Complaint Intelligence System for Government Decision Support**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Government departments receive **large volumes of complaints** across multiple sectors.  
Manual verification, prioritization, and routing of these complaints leads to:

- Delayed responses
- Inefficient resource allocation
- Missed high-risk or high-impact issues
- Poor visibility into departmental performance

This project addresses these challenges by providing an **AI-driven intelligence and decision-support system** for government administrators.

## 👥 Primary Users

- Government Officers  
- Department Heads  
- Policy Makers  
- Administrative Analysts  

> ⚠️ This system is **not intended for citizens**.

## 🔑 Core Features

### 1. Complaint Verification
- Detects incomplete, irrelevant, or suspicious complaints
- Flags potentially fake or low-quality submissions

### 2. Complaint Classification (ML/NLP)
- Automatically categorizes complaints by:
  - Department
  - Issue type
  - Severity
- Uses Natural Language Processing for text understanding

### 3. Priority Scoring Engine
Complaints are scored based on:
- **Impact** (public safety, infrastructure, welfare)
- **Urgency** (time sensitivity)
- **Volume** (number of similar complaints)

### 4. Duplicate Detection & Merging
- Identifies duplicate or near-duplicate complaints
- Merges them into a single actionable case

### 5. Sentiment & Risk Analysis
- Sentiment detection (anger, distress, urgency)
- Risk flagging for:
  - Law & order issues
  - Public safety threats
  - Media-sensitive cases

### 6. Department Auto-Routing
- Automatically assigns complaints to the appropriate department
- Reduces manual forwarding delays

### 7. SLA Tracking & Escalation
- Tracks resolution timelines
- Auto-escalates complaints when SLA thresholds are breached

### 8. Performance Analytics Dashboard
- Department-wise performance metrics
- Resolution time analysis
- Backlog and trend visualization

### 9. Predictive Insights
- Forecasts complaint surges
- Identifies recurring governance issues
- Supports proactive policy decisions

### 10. Report Generation
- Generates administrative and policy-level reports
- Exportable formats for audits and reviews
